# What makes a top choice listing in Westminster?

## Dataset
[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data)  
Dataset in the field of accommodation, including information about 36.431 listings in London of Airbnb platform.  
There is no available data on the actual number of bookings over the years. 
Instead, I estimate the demand by looking at the number of reviews.

## Project Objective
* The purpose of this project is to identify factors that distinguish a normal listing to a outstanding (top booking) listing in Westminster (London).
## Tech Stack
* Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib): [Notebook for this project](Analysis.ipynb)
* Tableau: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Milestone_16752659315130/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
## Conclusion of project
* 4.5 is the lowest point review that host should remain at.
* Private room is a top priority.
* 15-20 amenities is preferred. Standard amenities: Long term stays allowed, Wi-fi, Smoke alarm, Essentials, Hair dryer, Iron, Hangers, Hot water, Heating.
* Maintaining high standards and competition constantly, your Superhost status will look after itself, then you can attract more and more guests.
